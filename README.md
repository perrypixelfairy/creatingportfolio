Trying to put 20 years of varied graphic design work into a web portfolio.
my name is Beth. I like clean, informative design. 

Tangent: Changes for the sake of changes irritate me. You have to balance improving navigation with what the user is familiar with. When very well known websites, especially social media make navigation changes, it often seems that some designers and code writers are justifying their existence within the company. (Moving a link to a function. Renaming functions. using obscure names for functions that an average user won't understand.) Logical navigation is important, but there is a reason why a kicthen bread toaster design has not changed drastically for the last 50 years. Make the engineering better, make it use electricity, but make sure that the user is not going to so confused that it wastes their time.

I'd like to sketch out navigation for my web design portfolio. 
The challenges will be
• to make an easy to update site
• to make the interface balance between the latest trends in design but keeping a classic look that won't look dated.
• to make a logical navigation: categories of output, clients, use . . .
• to keep it safe from hacks
• and more
